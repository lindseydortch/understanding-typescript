# Section 1: Getting Started

## Welcome to the Course!
- With TypeScript you can write less error prone and cleaner code 
- We will learn TypeScript from scratch 
- We will be working on real projects that combine TypeScript with Node and React 

## What Is TypeScript & Why You Should Use It?
- What Is TypeScript? 
  - A JavaSCropt Superset 
  - A language building up on JavaScript 
  - Adds new Features + Advantages to JavaScript 
  - Browser's CAN'T execute it! 
  - TS -- Compiled to --> JavaScript 
    - Features are compiled to JS "workarounds", possible errors are thrown
- Why TypeScript? 
  - Calling a function that does addition with strings, which leads to unwanted behavior at runtime 
    - Mitigation Strategies 
      - Add if check to add function Validate & sanitize user input 
        - Developers can still write invalid code 
          - TypeScript is a "Tool" that helps developers write better code

## Installing & Using Typescript
- You can install typescript globally: 
  - `npm install -g typescript`
  - What we installed is the compiler, so it will compile our typescript file to js 
- You should use VSCode with TypeScript because it comes with great built in support when working within typescript files 
- ! - tells TypeScript this will always return a value 
- To compile our TS using the terminal  
  - `tsc <filename>` 

## TypeScript Advantages - Overview

    - Non-JavaScript Features like interfaces or Generics 
    - Meta-Programming Features like Decorators 
    - Rich Configuration Options 
    - Modern Tooling that helps even in non-TypeScript Projects
